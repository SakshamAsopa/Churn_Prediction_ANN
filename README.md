# Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a deep learning model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers by identifying those who are likely to leave.  

## 🔍 Features  
- Preprocessed customer data with feature engineering  
- Implemented an ANN with TensorFlow/Keras  
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualization of results and feature importance  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes customer demographics, account details, and behavioral data. Features include:  
- **Numerical**: Age, Balance, Estimated Salary, etc.  
- **Categorical**: Geography, Gender, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, etc.  
- **Target Variable**: Churn (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements  
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🚀 Training the Model  
To train the ANN model, run:  
```bash
python train.py
```
## 📊 Evaluation  
The model is evaluated based on:  
- **Confusion Matrix**  
- **ROC-AUC Curve**  
- **Precision-Recall Metrics**  

## 📜 Results  
The model achieves an accuracy of **XX%**, with an F1-score of **YY%**. Further tuning can improve performance.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV  
- Try advanced architectures like CNNs or Transformer-based models  
- Deploy as a REST API for real-time predictions
